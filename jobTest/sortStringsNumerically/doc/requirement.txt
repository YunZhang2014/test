We have a set of strings which contain measures of length 
which we would like sorted numerically. 
Provide a Java application which completes the following Java method:

public List sortStringsNumerically(List input)


Example input: [“1m”, “1.5m”, “10m”, “2m”, “2.5m”, “3m”]
Expected output: [“1m”, “1.5m”, “2m”, “2.5m”, “3m”, “10m”]
