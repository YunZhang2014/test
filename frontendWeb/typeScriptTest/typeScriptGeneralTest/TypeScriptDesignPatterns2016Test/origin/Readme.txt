There are no additional code bundle for the following chapters:

Chapter 8
Chapter 9


Chapter 8 is mainly about explaining SOLID principles, so the code snippets is about concept without actual implementation.
Chapter 9 is about a workflow and related configurations, so it is rather trivial to put them as code snippets into files.
