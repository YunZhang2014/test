This influence derives from the fact that when an element is floated, other content “flows around” it. This is familiar
behavior with floated images, but the same is true if you float a paragraph, for example. In Figure 10-2, you can see
this effect quite clearly, thanks to the margin added to the floated paragraph:
<img src="b4.gif" style="float: left;" alt="b4">
</body>
</html>
